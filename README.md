# Prolance – Smart Freelancing Platform - ESPRIT School of Engineering - BACKEND

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **PIDEV – 4th Year Engineering Program** at Esprit School of Engineering (Academic Year 2025–2026).

Prolance is an advanced, AI-driven freelancing ecosystem. It integrates Agentic AI for smart moderation and Real-Time OLAP tracking to provide deep behavioral analytics. The platform focuses on high-quality advertisement management and secure, identity-aware interactions between freelancers and recruiters.
